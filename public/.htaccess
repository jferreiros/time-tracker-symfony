    # Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content
    # (with and without `/index.php`). Only do this redirect on the initial
    # rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an
    # endless redirect loop (request -> rewrite to front controller ->
    # redirect -> request -> ...).
    # So in case you get a "too many redirects" error or you always get redirected
    # to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECT_STATUS
    # environment variable, you have 2 choices:
    # - disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines, or
    # - use Apache >= 2.4.13 or replace all occurrences of `%{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS}`
    #   with `%{ENV:REDIRECT_REDIRECT_STATUS}`

    # We only want to let Apache serve files and not directories.
